## Made using Unity Version - 2020.2.1f1
<br>
"pathfinding means finding the path"... das deep
<br>
### DESCRIPTION
- Normal tower defense game.. stop catapults from getting to the end point by placing towers which cost gold..<br>
- you have a certain amount of gold, the gold decreases by a certain value if a catapult reaches the end point,<br>
- the gold increases by a certain value if you kill a catapult.. The difficulty gets ramped up as the level goes on..
- The level just restarts when you die and there is no win condition, survive as long as u can.. 
- The catapults follow a path and they update path according to the obstacles placed in the way
<br> <b> The game is not pretty, just making mechanics cuz I wanna learn some game design principles and stuff</b>


### STUFF LEARNED
- Queues, Dictionaries, KeyValuePairs, Lists and some other data structures and their practical usage
- Unity script Execution order (must never in my life since it overcomplicates simplest of things)
- How to make independent C# classes which do not inherit monobehaviour and use them for making nodes and stuff
- Coordinate labeler doesnt work and the udemy course instructor did an oopsie and put some error type code
- Using property instead of static public variables everywhere
- If you commit from command line in VSCode, the editor changes also get comitted to github 
- So there is practically no need for using github desktop while doing commits
- 
- 
- When you get into a situation like : WHY IS THIS SHET NOT WORKING" said dumbledore calmly.
- Walk away from the PC, hardcore gaming (or some other work which you have to do) for like 2-5 days
- Come back totally relaxed and get good sleep everyday ofcourse.
- Fixing the error will feel so effortless that it will look like it fixed itself
